  <h1>Adversarial Attacks: Unveiling the Dark Side of AI</h1>
  <p>Exploring how small changes can fool powerful machine learning systems</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
  
  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized industries, from healthcare to finance, by enabling systems to make decisions, recognize patterns, and automate tasks. However, with great power comes great responsibility—and risk. One of the most concerning vulnerabilities in AI systems today is the phenomenon known as an <strong>Adversarial Attack</strong>.</p>

  <h2>What are Adversarial Attacks?</h2>
  <p>Adversarial attacks involve deliberately manipulating input data to deceive machine learning models. These tiny, often imperceptible changes can cause models to misclassify images, text, or speech. For example, adding specific noise to a stop sign image might make an AI-powered car misinterpret it as a speed limit sign, leading to dangerous outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Types of Adversarial Attacks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>White-box attacks:</strong> The attacker has full access to the model, its architecture, and parameters.</li>
    <li><strong>Black-box attacks:</strong> The attacker only interacts with the model through its outputs and attempts to infer weaknesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Targeted vs Non-Targeted attacks:</strong> Targeted attacks push the model toward a specific incorrect output, while non-targeted attacks simply aim to cause any wrong prediction.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>How Do Adversarial Attacks Work?</h2>
  <p>These attacks exploit the mathematical nature of machine learning models. By computing gradients and finding minimal perturbations that alter outputs, attackers can craft malicious inputs that look identical to the original data for humans but completely mislead the AI model.</p>

  <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Researchers have tricked facial recognition systems by wearing patterned glasses.</li>
    <li>Autonomous vehicles have been misled by stickers placed on road signs.</li>
    <li>Spam filters can be fooled by altering just a few words in an email.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Defending Against Adversarial Attacks</h2>
  <p>Several defense mechanisms exist, including adversarial training, input preprocessing, gradient masking, and robust optimization. However, no solution is foolproof. The field is still evolving as both attack and defense methods grow more sophisticated.</p>

  <h2>Ethical and Security Implications</h2>
  <p>As AI becomes more integrated into critical systems, adversarial robustness becomes not just a technical challenge but a moral imperative. Ensuring the safety of autonomous systems, biometric authentication, and medical AI requires resilience against such vulnerabilities.</p>
