  <h1>Adversarial Attacks in Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  <p>Understanding How AI Models Can Be Tricked and How to Defend Against It</p>
</header>

<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized industries by enabling systems that can recognize images, process natural language, and make predictions. However, AI systems are not flawless. One of the most concerning vulnerabilities in AI, especially in deep learning models, is the phenomenon known as “Adversarial Attacks.” These attacks involve small, carefully crafted changes to input data that deceive AI models into making incorrect predictions — often without human detection.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Are Adversarial Attacks?</h2>
    <p>Adversarial attacks manipulate AI models by introducing tiny perturbations into the input data. For instance, a neural network trained to identify traffic signs may misclassify a stop sign as a speed limit sign if subtle modifications are made to the image. These modifications are often imperceptible to the human eye but significantly affect model outputs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of Adversarial Attacks</h2>
    <p>Adversarial attacks can be categorized based on their access level to the target model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>White-box attacks:</b> The attacker has full knowledge of the model, including architecture and parameters.</li>
      <li><b>Black-box attacks:</b> The attacker only knows the model’s output for given inputs and crafts attacks based on observed responses.</li>
      <li><b>Targeted vs. Non-targeted attacks:</b> Targeted attacks aim for a specific incorrect output, while non-targeted attacks only intend to cause misclassification.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Real-World Implications</h2>
    <p>Adversarial attacks pose serious security risks in applications like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical diagnostics. Imagine a self-driving car misinterpreting a stop sign, or a medical AI misclassifying a malignant tumor as benign — both could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Defense Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>To counter adversarial attacks, researchers have developed several strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Adversarial Training:</b> Retraining models with adversarial examples improves robustness.</li>
      <li><b>Gradient Masking:</b> Reduces the model’s sensitivity to input changes, making attacks harder.</li>
      <li><b>Input Preprocessing:</b> Using filters or transformations to remove potential perturbations.</li>
      <li><b>Model Verification:</b> Ensuring mathematical guarantees of robustness under certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Adversarial attacks highlight the importance of developing secure and interpretable AI systems. While AI continues to advance, ensuring its reliability and safety in the presence of malicious actors remains a critical research area. The future of AI security lies in combining machine learning with robust verification and continuous defense adaptation techniques.</p>
